# daisy-seed-boilerplate

This repository provides a simple starting point for hardware DSP projects using the Daisy Seed platform.

It includes a minimal example firmware that bypasses the audio input directly to the output, and the Daisy library needed to build and run your projects.

## Building

- `make build_libs` - Build the libraries (libDaisy)
